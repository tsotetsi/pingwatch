We love ideas that make PingWatch better! When suggesting enhancements:

- Use the feature request template if available.

- Explain the use case and value it provides.

- Include examples if possible.

- Consider whether it aligns with PingWatch's scope.

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged good-first-issue or help-wanted. You can also:

- Improve documentation - always valuable!

- Fix typos in code or documentation.

- Add tests to improve coverage

- Optimize performance - like the Alpine optimization that reduced image size by 68%! ðŸš€

## Development Setup

### Local Development

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tsotetsi/pingwatch.git
cd pingwatch

```

# Test the built image.
docker run -it pingwatch:dev
```

### Testing

```bash
# Add your test commands here once available.
```

## Pull Request Process

We love PRs! Here's how to make them great:

- Fork the repository.

- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b <type>-<issue_number#>-<amazing-feature-name>`).

- Make your changes.

- Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m '<type>[Optional scope]: <description>'`).

- Availeble types: `feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci` etc.

- Open an issues on github if minimal neccesary details.

- Rename you branch, with a prefix, using the issue number from above.(`git branch -m <type>-<issue_number>-amazing-feature-name`).

- Push to your branch (`git push origin <type>-<issue_number>-amazing-feature-name`).

- Open a Pull Request. PR's would be reviewed withing 8 hours.

**PR Guidelines**

- Describe what and why - Explain what your PR does and why it's needed.

- Reference issues - Link to any related issues.

- Keep it focused - One feature/fix per PR is ideal.

- Test your changes - Ensure everything works as expected.

- Update documentation - If you change functionality, update the docs.

- We'll review your PR promptly and help you get it merge-ready! We welcome all contributions and believe in working collaboratively.

## Code Standards**

To maintain code quality and consistency:

- Follow existing style - Match the code style you see in the codebase.

- Write clear commit messages - Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

- Comment complex logic - Help others understand your reasoning.

- Keep it simple - Simple, maintainable code is better than clever, complex code.

- Consider performance - Especially important for a monitoring tool like PingWatch(Background task and battery drain).

## Recognition

We believe in giving credit where it's due! All contributors get recognition through:

- Contributors list in our README.

- Shout-outs in release notes.

- Direct thanks in merged PRs.

Great contributions like the use of python alpine image for optimization that reduced our image size by 68%
are exactly what we love to see! Your work makes a real difference.
